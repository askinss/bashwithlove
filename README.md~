# bashwithlove
bash script that echo random color of love on terminal

After a long work day, what started as part of my Linuxartistry play on terminal ended up in an amateur script.<br/>
Give a geeky love greetings to some this valentine and making the terminal not all sound boring to others, just show them some love with the script
tweak it to better suit your need.


#USAGE
on terminal run the script<br/>

./love.sh or bash love.sh<br/>
It does no harm it only shows some colored love, should try it.

#Requirements
figlet
sudo yum install figlet<br/>
sudo apt-get install figleti<br/>


#OUTPUT
